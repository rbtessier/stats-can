# Labour Force Survey Data

This is a project analyzing labor force survey data.

List of questions

- How does yearly income vary by profession?


# Things to try

0. Compute a yearly income column
0. Use Lasso regression to try to identify features important to predicting yearly income
0. Use Ridge regression to predict yearly income (however what to do with text data?)


# June 4 2022

Previously finished up part of my lfs python code to process the raw LFS survey data and add the survey labels and replace the survey codes values with their semantic values.

Added `.gitignore` file to ignore `.pbix` and data files.



# To Come

Planning to use this stuff on website for company - embed LFS dashboard PBIX file and make the processed LFS data available for people.
